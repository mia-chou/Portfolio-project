  <div class="about-desc">
  I'm a freelance frontend developer based in West Yorkshire, Leeds, holding a Masters degree in Communication and Media. About a year ago, 
  I started learning to code because I wanted to understand how my web app projects worked behind the scenes. 
  While I was good at designing websites and media using design software, I wanted to dive into coding to build and improve my projects.
  I bring a strong skill set in web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
  and responsive design. I love learning new things, especially about new software and automation technology, 
   and I thrive in collaborative environments and welcome fresh and innovative challenges to create a positive influence in the digital world.
