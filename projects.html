      Explore a collection of projects coded by myself. Each project possesses
      a variety of skills that I have learnt - ranging from API Integrations,
      AI, general CSS/Flexbox properties and React.js.

             This app allows the user to type an ingredient into the search
              engine and a recipe will be returned using an AI API. Any
              ingredient can be submitted into the search and the API will
              collect the data and generate a response accordingly.
              Search for cocktail recipes by ingredient or name. The recipes are populated by the API Ninja's Cocktail API. Choose between light or dark mode. This project was coded with HTML, CSS & Javascript.
